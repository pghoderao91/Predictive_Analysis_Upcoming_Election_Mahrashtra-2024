## Predictive Analysis of Voting Result Using Machine Learning Techniques: A case study Maharashtra Assembly Election 2024

## Introduction :

In today’s dynamic political environment, accurately forecasting election results has become crucial for stakeholders involved in campaigns and policy planning. This project, titled "Predictive Analysis of Voting Result Using Machine Learning Techniques: A Case Study on Maharashtra Assembly Election 2024," aims to develop machine learning models to predict outcomes for the 2024 Maharashtra Assembly Election. By analyzing past electoral data with various regression algorithms, this study seeks to identify patterns and factors influencing voter behavior. The project’s findings can provide valuable insights for political strategists and contribute to a data-driven approach to understanding electoral trends.

## Project Business Goal

The project's goal is to develop a predictive model for the Maharashtra Assembly Election 2024, using machine learning techniques to analyze factors influencing election outcomes. By accurately forecasting election results, this model can provide valuable insights into voter behavior patterns, influence strategic decisions for stakeholders, and improve understanding of socio-political dynamics in the region. Predictive models like these can be beneficial for political parties, analysts, and researchers seeking to anticipate election trends and allocate resources more effectively.

## Model Creation & Result Summary

Linear Regression: A simple model often used as a baseline; this achieved an R² score of 0.67, showing moderate predictive capability for election results.

Support Vector Regressor (SVR): Known for handling complex relationships, SVR obtained a slightly lower R² score of 0.66, suggesting that this model may not fully capture the data's intricacies in this case.

Decision Tree Regressor: A non-linear model that did not perform as well, with an R² score of 0.59, likely due to overfitting on small data variations.

Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble method that combines multiple trees, achieving a high R² score of 0.78 due to its improved generalization abilities.

Gradient Boosting Regressor: Another ensemble technique, it performed very well with an R² score of 0.82, indicating strong predictive power for election outcomes.

XGBoost Regressor: Known for efficiency and accuracy, this algorithm also scored 0.79, showing comparable performance to Gradient Boosting.

CatBoost: This boosting model, particularly effective on categorical features, achieved an R² score of 0.82, matching Gradient Boosting in prediction accuracy.
